## Animations

### Page Transitions

To enhance the user experience, smooth page transitions are applied using **React-Spring**. These transitions create a dynamic feel as the user navigates between different sections or pages. The pages smoothly slide in and fade in or out, mimicking native app behavior.

- **Animation Type**: Slide and fade transitions.
- **Libraries Used**: React-Spring for animations.

### Hover Effects

Hover effects are used to provide interactive feedback to users. For example, when a user hovers over a video thumbnail or a button, the element slightly scales up, giving the impression of being clickable. This provides a more engaging and responsive feel.

- **Element Affected**: Video thumbnails, buttons, and other interactive elements.
- **Animation Type**: Scale-up on hover.

### Loading Animations

While videos or data are loading, a skeleton loader or spinner animation is displayed. This helps maintain the user's attention by indicating that the content is being fetched.

- **Animation Type**: Skeleton loading animation for video thumbnails and text.
- **Libraries Used**: CSS keyframes or React-Spring for smooth loading animations.
